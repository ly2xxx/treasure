I need to develop a new feature using my development crew:

Feature: Add Denmark treasure locations to Treasure Map Explorer
Language: Python

Please coordinate this workflow:
0. Study the format of json files under raw/ folder carefully, your task is to research the likely Treasure Locations in Denmark according to your knowledge (search internet if necessary) and create Denmark.json under the same location with your research outcome. Tip: The result should contain the following columns "Location, Coordinates (Approximate), Treasure Value, Likelihood (%), Recommended Reason, Supporting Evidence, Supporting Evidence URLs"
1. Use claude-code-developer to create a feature branch and generate the json file. Create a unit test to make sure the new json locations render correctly in streamlit UI.
2. Use gemini-qa-agent to review the generated code for security.
3. Use claude-code-developer to implement suggested improvements.
4. Use gemini-qa-agent to run and generate comprehensive tests.
5. Commit the final implementation when you are comfortable with the outcomes, and create pull request to 'main' branch

Execute this workflow step by step.
